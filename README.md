# cds (C Data Structures)
C Data Structures is a helpful library for C programs that use basic data structures not natively supported in the c standard library. 
Each data structure is in its own .h/c file so you can pick and choose which ones you want to include and compile into your project. 
You could also compile them all into a single shared library for easy access.

There are also demo programs found in the demos folder for each data structure showing how to use each one in conjuction with some helpful utility functions found in utility.h
